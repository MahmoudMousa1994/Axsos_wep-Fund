                            <p>A full-stack developer passionate about building thoughtful, high-quality web applications from front-end to back-end.
                            I focus on clean code, scalable architecture, and user-centered design to deliver solutions that are both functional and elegant.
                            </p> <br>
                        <p>
                            In addition to my technical expertise, I bring strong soft skills to every team I join. My leadership skills were shaped through 10 years of experience as a construction contractor, where I managed teams, coordinated complex projects, and made fast, high-stakes decisions under pressure.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p>
                            I'm adaptable, passionate, and a strong team player who values honest communication, creative problem-solving, and continuous growth.
